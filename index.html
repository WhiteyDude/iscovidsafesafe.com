          <br />
          <p>Currently the COVIDSafe app <strong>meets 0/4</strong> of the conditions required for <strong>reasonable safety</strong>. These conditions however, are all achievable by the government and can allow for significantly greater confidence in the app and their own integrity. These conditions are:</p>
          <h4>Code integrity</h4>
          <p><strong>State:</strong> <span class = "text-success">Good</span></p>
          <p>
            DTA has released the source code within the promised timeframe<sup><a href = "#ref-21">[21]</a></sup>. The source code is missing some data and there are some questions around the licensing of the code, but overall this is great.
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of developers have decompiled and analyised the source code of the Android version of the app, and have shown it to be correct in terms of data promised to be collected and no known exploits/backdoors.<sup><a href = "#ref-19">[19]</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <h4>Data access and retention</h4>
          <p><strong>State:</strong> <span class = "text-warning">Improving</span></p>
          <p><strong>Ways to improve:</strong> Once parliament sits, pass laws to match the existing Emergency Determination.</p>
          <p>
            An Emergency Determination<sup><a href = "#ref-6">[6]</a></sup> has been introduced by Health Minister Greg Hunt limiting how data can be collected by COVIDSafe and who can access it. However concerns have been raised<sup><a href = "#ref-7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href = "#ref-8">[8]</a></sup> over the <strong>lack of provision for oversight and reporting</strong>. It is expected that proper laws related to privacy protection and restrictions to data will be introduced in May<sup><a href = "#ref-9">[9]</a></sup> when parliament re-sits. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the Emergency Determination made states that it is illegal to <i>"cause COVID app data ... to be retained on a mobile telecommunications device for more than 21 days."</i><sup><a href = "#ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. The Determination also states that the Australian Government <i>"must cause COVID app data in the National COVIDSafe Data Store to be deleted after the COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic has concluded."</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Draft legislation (the <i>Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Bill 2020</i></sup><sup><a href = "#ref-23">[23]</a></sup>) has been put forward to parliament, which mirrors fairly well the Emergency Determination<sup><a href = "#ref-22">[22]</a>.
          </p>
          <h4>Independent audit</h4>
          <p><strong>State:</strong> <span class = "text-warning">Average</span></p>
          <p><strong>Ways to improve:</strong> Form the committee promised and release reports. Release report from the CSCRC, and any reports from the ASD.</p>
          <p>
            Both Health Minister Greg Hunt and Shadow Health Minister Chris Bowen have indicated that there is to be a "parliamentary oversight committee" to scrutnise the COVIDSafe app<sup><a href = "#ref-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href = "#ref-12">[12]</a></sup>. However, <strong>no indication has been given</strong> as to when this will be or what this committee will be scrutinising. Given parliament don't sit again until May, it's likely <strong>the horse will already have bolted</strong> at this stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Department of Health has stated that they will seek "independant" advice from the Australian Signals Directorate in relation to data security<sup><a href = "#ref-13">[13]</a></sup>. No transparency has been provided on this however - the ASD has not provided any public statement, nor has any report relating to measures taken been published. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre have released a statement stating it has "no major concerns about the app". The organisations review is being handed to the government on Tuesday, however it has not been confirmed if this review will be made public. <sup><a href = "#ref-14">[14]</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <h4>Guaranteed sovereignty of data</h4>
          <p><strong>State:</strong> <span class = "text-danger">Poor</span></p>
          <p><strong>Ways to improve:</strong> Ideally move all backend to an Australian based provider. At minimum, ensure that encryption keys are stored with an Australian provider and are never used on non-soverign hardware.</p>
          <p>
            Concerns have been raised about the government's use of Amazon Web Services to store both the encrypted contact data from COVIDSafe, and the encryption keys used to decrypt the data<sup><a href = "#ref-15">[15]</a></sup>. The primary issue from this relates to the CLOUD Act, law introduced in the US in 2018 that allow the US government to require US based cloud providers operating in Australia (such as Amazon Web Services) to "to hand over data requested by US law enforcement authorities"<sup><a href = "#ref-16">[16]</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <del>Labor MP Ed Husic has raised stated he had been in formed that the Australian Signals Directorate has raised concerns around AWS and the Sydney data centre in question, and - a month earlier - the Department of Home Affairs has advised the Government to move their data out of there by September this year<sup><a href = "#ref-17">[17]</a></sup>.</del>
            <br />
            The Digital Transformation Agency has come out on record to ITWire, stating <i>"No COVIDSafe information will be stored in Global Switch facilities"</i><sup><a href = "#ref-18">[18]</a></sup>.</del>
          </p>
          <p>
            Concerns have also been raised over Australian based providers being overlooked, despite having the relevant government accreditations to host such data, such as AUCloud, Macquarie Telecom, Sliced Tech and Vault<sup><a href = "#ref-15">[15]</a></sup>.
